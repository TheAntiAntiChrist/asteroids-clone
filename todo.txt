-powerups:
	-automatic laser firing and then fire-rate upgrades
	-laser penetration (going through multiple asteroids before destroying the laser)
	-temporary shield to prevent dying from an asteroid collision
	-permanent health powerups that give you more health (more collisions before death) - regenerate over time
	-slow-mo (asteroids are slowed down)

	relative rarity is measured from 1-5 with 1 being the rarest:
		-laser firing speed upgrades are a 3
		-laser penetration is a 2
		-temp shield is a 4
		-slow mo is a 1
		-perma health is a 5
